# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

Created a calender application that allows the user to plan and save events each hour of the day from 9am-5pm. When certain time has passed, the event should turn gray, when it is happening, it wil turn green, and future events will be red. Used HTML, CSS, and jQuery.
